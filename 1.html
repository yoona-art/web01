<h2>welcome to my channel everyone 내 채널에 놀러온 걸 환영해 </h2>

I am a <strong> steady prospective <u> designer </u > </strong> who entered Hongik University in 2020. <p>
My <a href ="https://en.dict.naver.com/#/entry/enko/648a64d60e7a4c2a855a8582dbe89253" target = "_blank " title = "definition of this word "> 
motto </a> is to achieve the goal of the day in silence and sincerity. <br>
The roots of excellence that are different from others are in sincerity, and if you don't know how to do it consistently <br>
 with one excuse or another, you can't shine no matter what talent you have.
It makes natural sense.
Based on this motto, I will move forward silently.</p>
