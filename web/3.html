<h2>what I do these days 나 요즘 뭐하고 지내냐구?? </h2>

It's already been a year since Corona broke out. I've been enjoying my home life. <br>
I used to love going out, but since I've been staying at home, my home staying life isn't bad. <br>
I think I've been doing more self-improvement, and now I've been studying at home. <br>
Recently, I've been studying colors, motion graphics, coding, and other things that can help me. <br>
Maybe it's because I haven't done it before, so it's very interesting and fun. <br>
I think I'll continue to study with interest and never get tired.<br>
I'm so sorry I couldn't go to school, but I still think I'm able to adapt to this kind of life.<br>
